On Instagram I often show what customers make with my sewing patterns and organic fabric. I then tag those images with #whatcustomersmade. You can find the same thing on the new instagram/polaroid/pinterest-like business cards. On the backside you can find my contact information and some space for writing something down. On the front side there is an image of a customer creation, the Zonen 09 symbol, the hashtag #whatcustomersmade and the blog/flickr/instagram/facebook/does-not-matter url to the customer creation featured in the image.
